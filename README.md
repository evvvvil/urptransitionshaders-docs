# **URP Transition shaders documentation**
 
## What does it do?

Extends URP shaders to allow users to transition / reveal / fade any object.

Retain all URP material features such a lighting, surface options, surface inputs, etc...
The idea isn't to rewrite URP shaders such as lit and unlit but to surgically add the transition feature while retaining all the URP features intact.

## How to use:

Import the URP-Transition-Shaders package. You should now have new shader options in any Unity material's "Shader" dropdown. In "Universal Render Pipeline" menu you now have new transition shaders such as "Lit-Transition" and "Unlit-Transition".
